We’re encountering an ORA-01401 error, which indicates an attempt to insert a value that exceeds the column size limit in the ACT_RU_VARIABLE table within our Camunda setup. This table stores process variables, and it’s unclear which specific variable or task is causing the oversized data insertion.

Current Findings:

No direct code in the application explicitly setting large values into ACT_RU_VARIABLE was found.
Potential sources of this issue include values being set via:
Task forms, listeners, or embedded expressions in BPMN models
Service tasks or external APIs
Next Steps & Estimated Time:

Enable SQL and Debug Logging: To capture details of the values being inserted and pinpoint the source.
Review BPMN Models and Listeners: Inspect for automatic variable assignments and any potentially large data.
Test with Controlled Data: Attempt to isolate specific fields or data elements that could be contributing to this issue.
This process will take some time due to the need for thorough investigation, including log analysis, BPMN model inspection, and controlled testing to confirm the exact variable causing the issue.
