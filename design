POC Update â€“ k6 Performance Testing
Set up a modular performance testing framework using k6 for customer service APIs.

Integrated dynamic JWT token generation via JWT utility and custom header (iam-claimsetjwt).

Implemented and validated test cases for key endpoints:
/getPaymentPref, /getCustChannelRefForPhysDest, /getPSNPreferences.

Used data-driven testing via customer_ids.txt with SharedArray.

Added a README with setup instructions, test execution guide, and project structure.
