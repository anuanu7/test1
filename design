📝 JIRA Ticket: Investigate High Max Response Time on /v1/direct/op/file/triggerToMq Endpoint
Summary:
Investigate the unusually high maximum response time (~293s) observed on the /v1/direct/op/file/triggerToMq endpoint, despite low average and percentile latencies.

Component: bdd-ms-op-file-process-service
Type: Task / Investigation
Priority: Medium
Labels: performance, latency-outlier, external-service

🔍 Background
While reviewing response time metrics, we observed a significant outlier:

Endpoint: /v1/direct/op/file/triggerToMq

Service: bdd-ms-op-file-process-service

Avg Response Time: 0.288s

P99.9: ~2.097s

Max Response Time: ⚠️ 292.886s

This suggests a rare but severe latency spike, possibly affecting downstream systems.

❓ Open Questions
Is this max time expected under certain conditions (e.g., retries, queue delays, batch flows)?

Are there known scenarios where this endpoint can take longer than 5 minutes?

Could this be tied to downstream I/O, MQ latency, or service degradation?

✅ Next Steps
 Reach out to the owning team to confirm if this is a known or acceptable behavior.

 Check logs/APM trace if available around the spike timestamp.

 Assess impact on calling services and error handling strategy.

 Add threshold alerting if needed.

Got it! Here's a generalized version:

> This is a low-risk SAST issue — the logged fields are structured, system-controlled inputs (not free-form user text).
> These are consistently logged elsewhere without sanitization, so no additional handling is required here.
