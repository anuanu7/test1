RestTemplate + @Retryable is the most suitable option as it integrates easily with our existing synchronous, blocking I/O model without introducing complexity. It allows us to implement retry logic declaratively using simple annotations and provides straightforward fallback handling with @Recover
After comparing various retry mechanisms such as RestTemplate + @Retryable, WebClient with Retry, Feign, and custom retry implementations, we have decided to implement RestTemplate + @Retryable as the most suitable option for our application.
